## Development

### Linting

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

```bash
brew install pre-commit
```

Run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts so that `pre-commit` can run automatically on `git commit`.

### Dev server

For local development, use the `start:dev` command to watch the project and
recompile on changes.

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
